                            <p class="description">Hi. My name is Abdul-Halim, and I'll be turning 17 at the end of the year. I was born in Adelaide, South Australia, but by descent, I am half-Greek and half-Indonesian. I currently live in Western Australia, and am home-schooled. As far as past education goes, I haven't yet finished high-school, but through OUA, I have completed some undergraduate courses, namely, the fundamentals of; mathematics, physics, English, 3D modelling, and programming. In order to be eligible for a Bachelor of IT, I am currently taking an RMIT course called "Introduction to Information Technology" (...which is what this website happens to be an assignment for, but you already knew that).&nbsp;My hobbies include football (⚽) and basketball.&nbsp;I’ve been interested in technology, particularly the concept of programming, for a long time. Since I was around 7, I used to make games in PowerPoint. Later on (since around 11), I made games in Scratch, a block coding website. More recently (last few years) I learnt Python and made some things there. I also learnt some Java, and, quite recently indeed, I learnt the basics of HTML and CSS.<br></p>

                            <p class="description">I’m Jarrod Murphy, I'm 29 years old and am working currently as a level 3 teacher’s aide where I work with the technology and workshop faculty’s helping in fields of IT and workshop duties. I completed my certificate III in digital media and information technology this year and this is when I started my new job. My education in IT has stemmed from a lifelong interest in Computers and technology. I’ve started my studies in the field of IT because I think it’s an ever growing and important industry that won’t be going away in the future. I like to play poker, mountain bike, go to the gym, online game. I came to RMIT because I have a full-time job and the convenience of being able to study single subjects online was ideal for me to try and slowly but surely get through all the subjects to hopefully finish and get a degree so I can earn more money in the long run. I expect to get a well-rounded knowledge of all aspects of the subject and find a specific field in the industry that may interest me more than others to pursue.&nbsp;Skills I would like to learn more about in this course would be an extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS, Microsoft Windows, Business Analysis, Python, Git and the ability to technically support with a high understanding&nbsp;in a security sense.</p>

                            <p class="description">My name is John Norberg, and I am a 21-year-old student currently living in Sweden but am trying to move back to Australia where my mum currently lives. The reason for me living in Sweden is because I hold dual citizenship (Swedish and Australian) and have moved several times between the two countries. I have always loved playing video games and some of my earliest memories are from when I was playing Mario on my Gameboy in the early 2000s. However, my interest in IT really started at my university in Sweden where I studied robotics, however; the program was split into roughly equal parts programming and electronics. So, while through studying the program I realized my interest in programming and the software aspect of IT, I also realized my lack of talent and general interest in electronics, so I decided to drop out of the program and peruse programming in Australia. Most of my experience in IT also stems from the 2 years I spent studying robotics.<br></p>

I completed my High School through UK British studies O/A levels on June 3rd 2021. Talking about my hobbies, I love reading and bullet journaling in my free time, one of my advanced professions is in watercolour painting; it is said to be one of the most difficult types of paintings but I find it really enjoyable as high skill is required. The reason&nbsp;i&nbsp;chose IT was because of my interest that had been built over the past years, speaking of which,&nbsp;<strong><em>information security analyst&nbsp;</em></strong>is my main cause of attraction in IT, seeing how IT has grown to be the main backend for almost everything. Though&nbsp;I&nbsp;don’t have any such experience in Information Technology I look forward on learning through RMIT.</p>

                    <p style="font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Abdul-Halim</strong><br>Doing work being the way I am, I will probably&nbsp;be more easily stressed and overwhelmed, and more likely to end up leaving things to the last minute and struggle with deadlines. On my own, that's all well and fine&nbsp;as long as&nbsp;I get it done. However, working with a group I have others depending on me and expecting of me. I am afraid that this will make it only more stressful, but I hope that I can get on top of things and get the work done.&nbsp;I also have a great reluctance to communicate (especially by phone!), and I normally never have to working alone, so I worry how that will fare during group work. I am also unsure of what I know and what I should know. I have never really done group work before, and I don't think I would make a very good group member, so I hope I don't let anyone down.&nbsp;To summarize the Big 5 results, I seem to&nbsp;be;&nbsp;open to ideas and interested in learning, easily side-tracked, mostly introverted, more co-operative, and easily stressed. When working with others, I would probably be reluctant to communicate (lower extraversion), but more co-operative (higher agreeableness). Hopefully I will be able to communicate efficiently, work more conscientiously, and stay calm.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif;"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jarrod Murphy</strong><br>Information from the tests&nbsp;I completed are a little&nbsp;contradicting,&nbsp;but I would like to think that means I have a&nbsp;well-rounded&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to perform in a team environment.&nbsp;A person with the&nbsp;entertainer personality&nbsp;is extraverted&nbsp;and observant so in this group environment I hope that will be positive in noticing things that need to be done and voicing it to the group appropriately without frustrating any others in the group.&nbsp;The big 5 test showed&nbsp;I'm very high on the&nbsp;negative emotionality&nbsp;which is unusual with the entertainer personality in my opinion. The rest are all around the same results which I think&nbsp;is positive working a group.<br></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif;"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; John Norberg</strong><br>The results I got from taking these&nbsp;3 personality&nbsp;test&nbsp;were&nbsp;about what I expected, although I had never thought about learning styles before so the results from that test were&nbsp;really interesting&nbsp;for me.&nbsp;The&nbsp;mysers-briggs&nbsp;rusult&nbsp;show that I am a logician, which states that I will tackle problems logically, not be too interested in social interactions&nbsp;and also&nbsp;have a “unusual ability to focus&nbsp;in&nbsp;depth to solve problems”. While I agree with this statement, I do have a problem with focus, as in I will&nbsp;either focus too much if I find a problem really interesting, or not enough if I don’t really have any interest in the problem. This, along with the fact that I am not as sociable as other&nbsp;people is definitely my biggest weakness while working in a group. Since I will have a hard&nbsp;time expressing my&nbsp;opnion&nbsp;with confidence and have ...<br></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif;"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kylie Copeland</strong><br>The results of the three tests indicate that I am task-orientated and that I would work well in an environment that is structured and&nbsp;systemized. The test results also agree that I have a pragmatic approach and I am suited for projects where I work on technical tasks. Based on these results, it is suggested that my best contribution to a team may be to take on the tasks that involve working on practical matters and problem solving.&nbsp;The results accurately reflect my perception of myself and correlate with what I’ve been told by others about the way I’m perceived. I actively and consciously base my decisions and my demeanor on good intentions. When faced with a problem, I do my best to think rationally and base my response on facts rather than feelings. Taking my strengths and personality traits into account when forming a team will&nbsp;maximize&nbsp;my productivity.<br></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif;"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maleeha Yasir</strong><br>Emotions and personality traits are important to know and understand to help us build relationships and express our feelings. They can be applied to develop good work practices and for social workers to build empathy and trust with our&nbsp;clients. When&nbsp;I think of myself, I think of crazy, loud, and downright honest. When I took a personality quiz, I got a little confused about how differently I see myself and how the computer or other people see me. There were a lot of things that I agreed with and then there were many things that I couldn’t comprehend how they related to me in any way. Basically, though, I agreed with my scores in Introverted, assertive, and intuitive: they were all qualities that honestly describe me.<br></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif;"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ngo Khanh Tung</strong><br>Taking the tests did help me to know more and how to improve myself.&nbsp;Creativity is among my greatest strengths. I tend to&nbsp;deliberately&nbsp;break&nbsp;the rules&nbsp;when I find it&nbsp;possible&nbsp;in order&nbsp;to&nbsp;make the work less monotonous&nbsp;and conventional. This is not a good thing when&nbsp;things get out of control and stray away from the&nbsp;set targets. I must&nbsp;be extremely cautious of the boundaries and learn to control my temptation.&nbsp;Trying to do things differently can&nbsp;affect the performance of teamwork,&nbsp;so&nbsp;it is important for me to learn how to communicate with others and have a clear plan which I usually lack.&nbsp;A&nbsp;<em>logician’s&nbsp;</em>ideas&nbsp;will eventually clash with other members of a group, especially with those who often go strictly to the rules. I must be prepared to&nbsp;resolve even upcoming conflicts so it will not interfere with my group’s performance. There is one noticeable characteristic about myself is I always keep being too quiet. This habit must change, not by being talkative but starting with sharing my feelings towards others, my thinking about the tasks&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;ideas that I found.<br></p>

                        <p style="font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif;">ABDUL-HALIM<br>I’m not entirely sure yet, but I think I<br>would choose something along the lines of a software developer, as I feel it<br>would be more programming oriented than some of the other IT related options. IT<br>skills I would need to attain include Java, C# and software engineering. I hope<br>to attain these skills and other related IT skills by studying through uni<br>degrees, such as the Bachelor of Information Technology and maybe Bachelor of<br>Computer Science. As far as the more general skills are concerned, I’ll need to<br>improve on my communication skills, and I think this has already been aided a<br>bit by practice in this course. I imagine through practice by course work, and<br>perhaps one day studying on campus, I could attain the necessary communication<br>skills required for a job of this type/caliber.<br><br>JARROD MURPHY<br>Cyber Security analyst was my chosen<br>profession and what initially got me interested in continuing my studies after<br>doing certificate III in information technology (IT) and digital media. This<br>job would require many years of study and is a long goal I would like to<br>achieve. After completing this bachelor's degree in IT, it would be important<br>to consider completing relevant industry certification, such as CompTIA security<br>+. Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH). It would also be good to complete a Master<br>of Business Administration (MBA) in information systems as this would look good<br>for an employer in this field. This job would require work experience in an IT<br>field most preferably being a networking or systems administrator background.<br>Analytical thinking is of the upmost importance in this field as well as having<br>problem solving skills that would help identify and assess risks, threats,<br>patterns and trends in a timely manner for a business sense.<br><br>JOHN NORBERG<br>The reason I<br>gravitated towards the senior software engineering job is because of two main reasons.<br>The first being that I love programming and getting to do it at a high-level<br>sound incredibly interesting, the second reason is because of variety. What I mean<br>by this is that I believe in such a position I could get a chance to work on<br>many different types of projects, since I tend to get bored/disinterested quite<br>easily having variety is a must for me. I do have some experience programming<br>in C as I have completed a few university courses in C programming, but they<br>were only at a beginner level, so to attain this position I will need to get a<br>lot more comfortable with programming and programming projects in a group. So,<br>while studying a such as a bachelors in computer science I will definitely need<br>to get a lot more practical programming skills and knowledge, as well as get<br>better at working in groups since I am far more used to just working in<br>projects alone.<br><br>NGO KHANH TUNG<br>My daily hobby routine involves games and<br>automations, I have got my attention to cloud computing and networking. I also<br>realized that networking is not only about dealing with hardware and routing<br>cables. A number of cloud services providers have made branches of new networking<br>jobs available. To approach closer to the IT industry by being a networking<br>engineer, deep understandings of cloud services as the companies’ needs, the<br>aspects of networking, computer systems and the basics of electronic<br>engineering are of importance, with up-to-date knowledges of cloud technologies.<br>I have known of and been interacting with Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.<br>Cyber security in networking also plays a crucial role. As a student, enhancing<br>soft skills such as communication skills, team work and planning skills should<br>be done simultaneously. I cannot be certain of networking engineering is the<br>final destination, but having knowledges and experiences here will assist my<br>pursuit of game development or data analysis if I change my career path one<br>day.<br></p>

                        <p style="font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif;"><strong>Abdul-Halim</strong><br><br>The job I chose (Software developer) ranks 19th<br>in the Burning Glass Top Titles data. However, it ranks first by far in the Top<br>Occupations data. What I gather from this is that is that a software developer<br>is reasonably high in demand from employers. <br><br>The listed general skills for this<br>occupation are; communication skills, problem solving, and detail oriented.<br>These skills rank 1st, 2nd, and 8th,<br>respectively, in demand from employers. Regarding IT-specific skills, the job type<br>has listed; Java, C#, and software engineering. These rank 2nd, 12th<br>and 15th respectively.<br><br>In honesty, I would say I have none of the<br>required skills, both general (communication, problem solving, detail oriented)<br>and IT specific (Java, C#, software engineering), to an adequate level. For<br>example, my communication skills are, although hopefully improving, pretty<br>lackluster. I learnt the basics of Java, but I’m sure not to level that a job<br>would require (also I haven't done it in a while, I’ve probably forgotten how to<br>do a lot of Java). The other skills I either have none or limited experience.<br><br>The data didn’t really affect my view of<br>the job, although I am not sure of whether I would want to pursue this type of<br>job anyway. Employer demand is hardly something I have the foresight to take<br>into account at this stage... my first priority would be to find a job that<br>would be interesting enough to make me look forward to it, if that makes sense.<br><br><strong>Jarrod Murphy</strong><br><br>My decision after looking at the Burning<br>Glass Data has solidified what job I would like to achieve even more than<br>before after looking at the data. Cyber Security Analyst aligns with my<br>interest in IT and the goals I had in mind when starting my studies. This<br>industry is rapidly growing and employment rate predictions in this field are<br>set to increase by a rate of %19.8 from 2020-2025 according to the seek job<br>market trends which you can view here <br><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/role/information-security-analyst">https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/role/information-security-analyst</a>.<br><br>&nbsp;IT specific skill rankings are 4, (Microsoft Windows/Operating Systems) 9,<br>(Business Analysis) 11, (Technical Support). Employers looking at this set of<br>skills after acquiring them would in my opinion be quite high as you must have<br>completed some study in business and have a well-rounded knowledge of operating<br>systems and the skills to fix any issues that may arise. SQL, JavaScript, Java<br>are all the highest-ranking IT skills that are desired by employers these<br>skills are in a different aspect of what job I have in mind, but I think some<br>of my studies will require me to learn some of these skills in the future which<br>may give me a more well-rounded skill set if I was to go into another field.<br><br>General skills rankings are 1, (Communication<br>skills) 2, (Problem Solving) 6, (Troubleshooting). These skills are the most<br>important based on the data provided and in my opinion. The 3 highest skills<br>that I do not have in my required skills are 3 (organizational skills), 4 (writing)<br>and 5 (teamwork/collaboration) skills.<br><br>John Norberg<br><br>Senior software engineer is the job I chose<br>and it ranks 16th in the burning glass data. As <br>per <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/role/software-engineer">https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/role/software-engineer</a><br>software engineering has a projected growth of 30% in the next 5 years, which<br>makes me draw the conclusion that the job is in fairly high demand. <br><br>The most common generic skills our group<br>has in common is communication and problem solving. Which rank 1st<br>and 2nd respectively in the Burning Glass data, while the most<br>common IT-specific-skill is software engineering, which ranks 15th<br>in the data. <br><br>The IT-specific-skills I would need for<br>this job do not rank that highly in the Burning Glass data (~10-20th<br>in the data list), however, the generic skills are in very high demand as I<br>would need both communication skills (1st in the data) and problem<br>solving (2nd in the list).<br><br>The 3 highest rank IT-specific-skills that<br>are not in my required skillset are the top 3 most desirable according to the<br>Burning Glass data; SQL, JavaScript and JAVA. For the generic skills however<br>the 3 most desirable excluding the ones I would need are organization skills,<br>writing and Team work/collaboration (3rd, 4th and 5th<br>in the list respectively).<br><br>After looking at the Burning Glass data my<br>opinion on wanting this job has not changed; however, I cannot say that a senior<br>software engineer is, without a shadow of a doubt, my dream job. Since I have no<br>experience working in IT, I don’t have much to base my decision on, so most<br>likely there is information that I am lacking right now which will affect how I<br>view this job in the future. But right now, this seems like a job which will fit<br>me well. From looking at the Burning Glass data I did get it confirmed that I<br>will need to get more skills in order for me to actually get hired into this<br>position, since as of right now the only skill I possess out of the ones I need<br>is communication skills. Luckily for me however that is, as per the data, the<br>most desirable generic skill!<br><br>Ngo Khanh Tung<br><br>The provided Burning Glass Data gives me an<br>overview of the jobs surrounding the current IT industry. Beside network<br>engineer as I chose, there are other worth-mentioning jobs that not only<br>catches my interest but also involves my pursuing skill-set, which makes it<br>harder to decide my final job with my limited knowledge.<br><br>Network engineer/architect still seems to<br>be a priority. Stading at the 15th position according to Top Burning<br>Glass Occupations (BGTOCCs), only 2,478 over 121,997 filtered postings which is<br>approximately 2% over 12 months. This number appears to be relatively small<br>compared to the more highly-demanded jobs. But this proves a small number of<br>networking engineers/architects are still required in the IT industry even with<br>the fast-sifting of technologies, especially Cloud computing.<br><br>Network Engineers/Architects are expected<br>to provide solutions regarding networking and cloud services to fit the<br>business models. Communication skills, which is expected to be the most needed<br>skill in IT industry, are also the first-and-foremost requirement in network<br>engineering. Organizational and planning skills, stood the 3rd and 7th<br>required general skills from the Burning Glass Data, are the keys to fulfill<br>the criteria for any business model.<br><br>There are a set of specialized skills which<br>are the most expected for being a Network Engineer. Many business models need<br>the proper utilization of SAP and ITIL to operate. These are quite common among<br>the IT-related skills which stood the 6th and 20th<br>positions from the Burning Glass Data. The 5th skill, project<br>management, will be closely related when most of the work are project-based.<br><br>From the chart of Distribution of<br>Experience Requirements for a Skill or Credential, it is apparent that 3 to 5<br>years are the most abundant from the job postings and by far exceed others. We<br>as students with less than 2 years of experience to none will see a lot of<br>challenges when seeking for a suitable job even after graduation.<br><br><strong>Maleeha Yasir</strong><br><br>The job i have chosen out of the Top Burning<br>Glass Occupations (BGTOCCs) is Information security analysts which are ranked<br>17th out of the data given. The U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects<br>32% employment growth in the field of information security analysts from<br>2018-2028, much faster than average, making the employment rank shoot over<br>these past few years.<br></p>

                        <p class="justify-content-center">Blockchain, much like the name is a chain<br>of blocks containing information or data. The technology was originally used to<br>timestamp digital documents so that it's not possible to backdate them or to<br>tamper with them, this went mostly unused though. The increase in interest in<br>blockchain technology came when the creator of bitcoin “Satoshi Nakamoto”<br>(which is a pseudonym) integrated blockchain into cryptocurrency when bitcoin<br>was created in 2009. A block chain is a distributed ledger that is completely<br>open to anyone. Once some data has been recorded inside the blockchain it<br>becomes exceedingly difficult to change it. The security from the blockchain<br>comes from its creative use of hashing which is when a transaction has been<br>verified and needs to be added to a block in the chain, it will be put through<br>a hash algorithm to convert it into a set of unique numbers and letters, like<br>what would be created by a password generator. The proof of work protocol which<br>is used by cryptocurrencies to validate the transactions that occur in their<br>networks. Also adding to the security of the blockchain is that it is<br>distributed over a Peer-to-Peer network (P2P) this means that even if one peer<br>goes down, the other peers are still present in the network. Therefore, cryptocurrencies<br>of all types make use of blockchain technology, Blockchains act as a<br>decentralized system for recording and documenting transactions. This<br>technology in the future could be used for many different things that need to<br>be used securely and efficiently to transfer user data across platforms and<br>systems. The technology could be sued to maintain and protect things like<br>records of real estate ownership, titles and more. <br><br>Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual<br>currency that is meant to be a medium of exchange. Cryptocurrency works much<br>like normal currency without the physical embodiment of money. It uses<br>cryptography and blockchain technology to record every transaction and ledger.<br>It is a decentralised system run over a P2P network to optimise security so<br>everyone on the network verifies the ledgers and transactions so that is hard<br>to tamper with the data. Cryptocurrency in the future could be used in<br>countries with very unstable economies. This would help the people in these<br>countries have a more stable financial environment. Cryptocurrency could also<br>bring a low-cost, high-speed way of making payments that could change the way<br>we exchange money and use banks, similarly to how the internet transformed the<br>way information was exchanged cryptocurrency could bring a revolution to the<br>way everyone regards money and banks. <br><br>For me personally I'm interested in this<br>technology as I've invested money into cryptocurrencies when there's dips in<br>the price and use it in the same way as you can with the stock market. Most of<br>my family and friends are usually overwhelmed with the explanation of this and<br>do not understand the concepts and technologies behind it which gets rather<br>frustrating and unfortunate. In my own opinion this could be rectified with simpler<br>ways of using and explaining the technology and methods you use to buy and sell<br>cryptocurrencies and use blockchain technology.<br></p>

                        <p class="justify-content-center">Many see the Internet as websites, software, and services where<br>they can perform their activities, finding information, gaming or even<br>socializing. But the Internet is much more than that. How about creating a<br>website, writing a software, compute a set of data or storing data? A term<br>‘Cloud Computing’ is born to indicate the activities of transferring data using<br>the Internet. It’s a broad term that describe almost any Internet activities.<br>Since the Internet is vast by its constantly development and complexity, the<br>following paragraphs will mention the importance and common uses of Cloud<br>Computing.<br><br>Chellappa first used the term “Cloud Computing” with the ideas<br>focusing on how cloud services can greatly impact small and medium-sized<br>enterprises and later business models [1]. Clouds services offer a wide range of<br><em>configurable computing resources</em> which are excellent for their flexibility<br>and scalability to meet most of the business’ models’ requirements and the<br>criteria from the users with <em>minimal management effort</em> [2].<br><br>Regarding the future uses of cloud computing, it is certainly the<br>most required for Internet of Things. Steering a bit to imagine how<br>self-driving cars work, the “AI” of the car will decide how the car runs on the<br>street just like us driving a car. All the cars that can measure the parameters<br>of the surroundings like temperature, humidity, traffics, route can be shared<br>with each other via the Internet, or the Cloud Computing we are mentioning. The<br>synchronization of the vehicles on the street makes it even possible to<br>eliminate the abundant needs for traffic lights. The cars accidents and traffic<br>congestion are expected to be significantly minimized at that point. These good<br>things will be followed by even more, like CO2 emission, lower fuel<br>consumption, less time spent on the street. The present of Internet’s services,<br>it should be more rapid to install and apply new software/firmware to the AIs<br>inside driving systems instead of physically dealing with the cars one by one<br>[3].<br><br>The existence of Cloud Computing makes many companies, especially<br>traditional ones shifting from being local to being on Cloud. The cost for<br>maintaining hardware storages, locations, local policies come from building a<br>local server. Cloud Computing provides means of computation, storage for many<br>organizations which help them being more fucus on other aspects of business<br>with less concerns on data, securities or even cost. Amazon Web Services (AWS)<br>and Google Cloud (GC) are very scalable and on-premises, shifting from high<br>computation power or high volume of storage capacity to lower ones and vice<br>versa are a matter of buttons. They even have tools for shifting and predicting<br>the needs of compute power and storage, like AWS Elastic Beanstalk.<br><br>With the power of a very recent technology, <em>Quantum Computing</em>,<br>a new field of Cloud technology is now opened. The quantum computers are now<br>implemented to be accessible via cloud services, users have never been closer<br>to the new power of quantum processing. Big cloud service companies have made<br>their ways to deliver such technologies on their platforms. <em>IBM, Microsoft,</em><br><em>Google </em>and<em> Amazon</em> have implemented such technology and continue to<br>develop further to make quantum computing more approachable for users. The<br>quantum computers can be harnessed by utilizing cloud computing without<br>physically having a quantum computer [4]. Even many have been able to reach<br>this very latest technology, not many impacts have been made since this way of<br>computing is still new and not very viable compared to the decades-worth<br>developments of traditional bit computing, and most of the activities are<br>around researching and testing. This is even worried by its compatibility with<br>other devices and technologies that we have already developed. By getting<br>closer to quantum computing by combining cloud computing, the development of<br>new quantum-based technologies will undoubtably skyrocket and greatly impact<br>not only computer science but other branches like medical, infrastructure,<br>transportation. It is still unknown how the quantum computing and cloud<br>computing will take us; however, with later years of great innovations and<br>developments, these new technologies will surely change the way we know how to<br>use a computer in the future.<br><br>The presence of cloud computing has great impact on the employees.<br>The shifting from local network infrastructure to cloud-based systems across<br>companies has been seen in the recent years. Almost 70% of organizations are<br>utilizing cloud services to cope the rising issues in the years of pandemic,<br>indicated by a Gartner survey in November [5]. A majority of companies prefer<br>cloud services because of their benefits including flexibility, scalability,<br>security, efficiency and possible cost reduction. This greatly impact the<br>workforce inside the IT industry. The needs for local storage and networks<br>which are required in many organizations will still exist but receive a great<br>reduction. This indicates the needs for network architect/developer will be<br>lower since less installation and maintenance are required.

                        <h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 27px;">Autonomous vehicles</h1><!-- Start: Date and Author -->
                        <p class="text-center"><span class="by">by</span> <a href="#JOHN">JOHN NORBERG</a><span class="date">Oct 15th,&nbsp; 2021</span></p><!-- End: Date and Author -->
                        <p>Autonomous vehicles are<br>vehicles which can be driven autonomously by an Artificial Intelligence (AI).<br>Most people will be familiar with self-driving cars, but the concept of<br>autonomous vehicles can be applied to any vehicle, such as tractors, airplanes,<br>and buses. [1] The basic principle for what makes an autonomous vehicle an<br>autonomous vehicle is that is it a vehicle which can fulfill its purpose<br>without any active human intervention, which is accomplished by allowing the<br>vehicle to sense its surroundings and have an AI make decisions. This will have<br>the possibility to revolutionize a huge variety of different fields such as<br>agriculture (self-driving tractors), public transportation (self-driving taxis,<br>self-driving buses etc), transportation of goods (self-driving trucks) and can<br>be a major help for people with disabilities since they will be able to be more<br>independent with the use of self-driving cars. However, there is also a large<br>array of various dangers with autonomous vehicles such as ethical concerns (AI<br>does not have a conscience), legal issues (who is at fault if an accident<br>occurs involving autonomous vehicles) and issues regarding military use. <br><br>Because the term<br>“autonomous vehicle” is so broad, different “levels” have been defined to<br>clearly explain how advanced/intrusive the “autonomous” part is. There are 6<br>defined and accepted levels, these being (in order 0-5) no automation, driver<br>assistance, partial automation, conditional automation, high automation, and<br>full automation. So, a regular manual car would be classified as a level 0<br>autonomous vehicles while a fully self-driving car (one without a human driver)<br>would be a level 5. [3] Currently most car manufacturers are focused on the<br>second level of autonomy, for example Tesla’s autopilot. <br><br>&nbsp;[4} Currently no true<br>level 5 autonomous vehicle exists. There are many reasons for this, such as the<br>technology for this is not here yet, numerous laws make allowing a level 5<br>vehicle onto public roads illegal/legal grey zone at best and the general<br>public’s opinion on a level 5 autonomous vehicle is very split, but many people<br>have negative opinions on them. Because of these issues there is a very low possibility<br>that level 5 autonomous vehicles will exist within the near future. <br><br>However, with how rapidly<br>both technology and public opinion change, the future for autonomous vehicles<br>is uncertain. Because autonomous vehicles rely on technology from so many<br>different areas, advancements made in any will increase the capabilities of<br>autonomous vehicles. Improving the study and understanding of artificial<br>intelligence will allow for the vehicles to, for example, make a more morally<br>correct choice in certain situations, improvements in sensor technology will<br>allow for a larger and more accurate amount of data for the AI to base<br>decisions of and so on. However, advancements in technology are not all which<br>has helped and will help the advancements of autonomous vehicles. Changing of<br>laws and regulations allow for better testing of autonomous vehicles since they<br>could then actually test the vehicles in their intended working environment,<br>and a change the public’s view on self-driving vehicles will also aid the further<br>advancements of them. These areas are ever changing, and because of this we<br>have the level of autonomous vehicles we have today, however, these same areas<br>might be the reason why we will never see autonomous vehicles reach their full<br>potential.<br><br>The publics opinion on<br>autonomous vehicles is the way it is right now because of many factors,<br>however, one the major ones is that autonomous vehicles will bring many drastic<br>changes to everybody. Allowing fully serf-driving cars onto public roads will<br>help people who are unable to drive reach a new level of independence, however,<br>depending on how it is handled it may make level 0 cars obsolete. Meaning the<br>loss of jobs such as driving school instructors and make driving licences<br>obsolete. Autonomous vehicles can replace truck drivers, and since truck<br>drivers’ entire career and skills are based upon them driving, they will be<br>unable to find another job easily without having to study a new field or work<br>jobs with minimum education requirements. However, autonomous vehicles don’t<br>just have the potential to boost the unemployment rates, they can also create<br>new jobs for people. A person who is unable to drive can make use of autonomous<br>vehicles to transport them to a job they otherwise would not have been able to<br>get to, and since autonomous vehicles are vehicles, they will break down<br>eventually. This can create a whole new industry of mechanics who specialize<br>not in fixing the mechanical aspect of the vehicles, but the computer and<br>software aspect. However, one thing is certain, autonomous vehicles will impact<br>everyone in some way, whether it be big or small, positive, or negative,<br>everyone will feel some form of effect form autonomous vehicles. <br><br>Autonomous vehicles would<br>affect me and my friends in numerous ways. As I have one friend who works as a<br>truck mechanic, I believe he would be the person closest to me to be affected<br>the most by autonomous vehicles. This is because his qualifications would<br>completely change, since he can fix the mechanical issues of a truck but not<br>the (theoretical) software aspect, if a truck with a software issue was booked<br>into where he works, he would be unable to fix it. However, a common change in<br>both mine and my friends lives from autonomous vehicles would be the devaluing<br>of driver’s licences. Since cars would be self-driving, having knowledge on how<br>to drive yourself does not bring much value or merit, other than maybe as an<br>anecdote at parties or as something to fill out a CV with. This could<br>potentially also affect my day-to-day life since I drive quite often, depending<br>on the laws and regulations put in place that allow for autonomous vehicles,<br>driving a car yourself may not be something which is allowed. This would change<br>my daily life substantially since I would need to find a new way to transport<br>myself, whether that be purchasing a self-driving car, walking, or taking<br>public transport, a solution would need to be found. And out of the available<br>solutions, only purchasing my own self-driving car would allow for the same<br>level of independence as having a level 0 car. This would of course also be<br>same for my family and friends.<br><br>[1]<a href="https://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/what-is-an-autonomous-vehicle">https://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/what-is-an-autonomous-vehicle</a><br>[2] <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/automotive/autonomous-driving-levels.html">https://www.synopsys.com/automotive/autonomous-driving-levels.html</a><br>[3] <a href="https://www.autopilotreview.com/cars-with-autopilot-self-driving/">https://www.autopilotreview.com/cars-with-autopilot-self-driving/</a><br>[4] <a href="https://level5auto.com/what-is-level-5-autonomous-driving/">https://level5auto.com/what-is-level-5-autonomous-driving/</a><br></p>

                        <p>In the near future, the self-learning artificial<br>intelligence system Skynet becomes self-aware. It considers humanity a threat<br>to its existence, and begins the extermination of the human race. This plot<br>from the Terminator films is what some people think of Machine Learning. But<br>what is Machine Learning really?<br><br>First, let’s take a look at how normal<br>computation is done. This is, in itself, a mystery to many people; it almost<br>seems like magic. Computing seems improbable; from lifeless materials, we have<br>managed to make a machine that can almost ‘think’. The secret to computers is<br>in the control of electrons, which is traced back to the incredible invention<br>of electricity (but we won’t go back that far). Computers calculate by a<br>special configuration of wires and circuits, accompanied by another great<br>invention of the 20th century: the transistor. Transistors work like<br>switches in the circuit and are made of (primarily silicon) what’s known as a<br>semiconductor, which can switch states between conducting and not conducting<br>electricity, allowing it to turn the flow of electricity on or off. This ‘on’<br>or ‘off’ state of electricity is represented as binary; 1 or 0. Amazingly, by<br>arranging just these two states of information in complex configurations, has<br>the potential to make complex calculations. Dealing with two states of<br>information, or Booleans, such as true or false, already had an established<br>area of mathematics, known as Boolean Algebra. The three basic operations in<br>Boolean Algebra are the NOT, AND, OR operations. The various Boolean operations<br>could be replicated by arranging the transistor circuits in specific<br>arrangements, known as ‘gates’. By the precise addition of more specific logic<br>gates, a circuit can be made to be able to calculate addition, and many more<br>complex functions.<br><br>Using programming, we can instruct computers to<br>perform many functions. However, the basic function of being told ‘If this,<br>then that’ is not enough for some more complex problems. That’s where Machine<br>Learning comes in. Machine Learning allows computers to analyse data and make their own decisions regarding it. Machine Learning is<br>an application of Artificial Intelligence; the concept of making computers make<br>human-like decisions. Machine Learning is a system that can learn from<br>experience and make improvements automatically. Here’s an example of Machine<br>Learning: let’s say we’re trying to make a program that can identify pictures<br>of cats and dogs. This is a simple task for humans, even very small children,<br>but it’s a bit more complicated for a machine. The way we ‘teach’ the machine<br>is similar to the evolutionary process of mutation and natural selection. A<br>random set of algorithms are created, and each are tested on distinguishing the<br>pictures of cats and dogs. Humans provide the test data with the answer key, in<br>this example, pictures of cats and pictures of dogs. The algorithms decisions<br>are marked according the answer key, or labeled data automatically, by the<br>human programmed testing bot. At first, you would end up with a bunch of<br>entirely random algorithms, some more successful than others. The most<br>successful algorithm survives, it and random variations of it are tested again.<br>Again, the most successful survives, and this continues until you get to a<br>point where the algorithm is accurate enough to tell apart the cats and the<br>dogs.<br><br>The term Machine Learning was first coined in<br>1952, where Arthur Samuel of IBM described a learning process in a computer<br>program for Checkers. At first, Arthur had created a system that analysed<br>Checkers positions and determined which side had a better chance of winning. He<br>developed ways to make the computer ‘learn’, by having the program remember the<br>positions it had already seen and applying a reward system. In 1997, a computer<br>known as DeepBlue which had trained on thousands of Chess Grandmaster’s games,<br>defeated the world Chess champion Garry Kasparov. This was the first time a<br>machine had defeated the world champion human at Chess. Machine Learning in its<br>current state has been produced to master strategy games such as Go and Chess,<br>and is being developed to learn to drive. There are many more applications of<br>Machine Learning, such as picture and audio recognition. In 2017, DeepMind<br>created AlphaZero, which learnt to play Go and Chess by playing against itself<br>thousands of times, learning by an AI system known as neural networking.<br>AlphaZero was powerful enough to defeat the top Chess engine in the world 28<br>times out of a 100, with NO losses (remaining games were drawn). Machine Learning<br>is also being used to train self-driving cars, to recognize the road lanes,<br>other cars, traffic systems, etc. In the present day, Tesla has developed a<br>self-driving car, which could learn from the data of hundreds of thousands of<br>cars in real life scenarios. Machine Learning is already used to adapt to you,<br>such as YouTube recommendation algorithms. Machine Learning companies are eager<br>for your data, as they can use it for the training process of their algorithms.<br><br>In the near future (for real this time), the<br>field of Machine Learning will see vast progress at an incredible rate. Machine<br>Learning is an extremely pivotal technology, and it will affect many<br>industries. By 2027, the global Machine Learning market is predicted to grow to<br>over 117 Billion dollars; almost 14 times more than it is currently. The future<br>will no doubt see Machine Learning improved tremendously and used as a<br>widespread technology, tightly intwined with people’s daily lives (it already<br>is, as a matter of fact). Machine Learning is a fundamental steppingstone to<br>many other revolutionary technologies, such as the Autonomous Vehicles and<br>Robots of today and the future. The introduction of electronic technology<br>replaced many jobs, as did the industrial revolution long before it. It’s hard<br>to imagine that the super intelligent systems developed by Machine Learning of<br>the future would not replace many more. Truck drivers drive long hours on end,<br>over many days, across the long desolate roads of Australia. In the future, if<br>Machine Learning is trusted enough, Autonomous Vehicles would have the ability<br>to replace the job of these drivers, taking control of the trucks themselves.<br>Perhaps taxis, buses, and other forms of public transport could be driverless.<br>If Robots could be developed and trained efficiently using Machine Learning,<br>they could identify objects and perhaps replace many heavy lifting and labour<br>jobs. It’s said that machines could even replace doctors in the future. Tesla<br>(perhaps jokingly) revealed that they were developing the ‘Tesla Bot’: “Develop<br>the next generation of automation, including a general purpose, bi-pedal,<br>humanoid robot capable of performing tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or<br>boring. We’re seeking mechanical, electrical, controls and software engineers<br>to help us leverage our AI expertise beyond our vehicle fleet.” Robots could<br>use Machine Learning to comprehend human speech and formulate coherent and<br>logical responses. Perhaps Robots could be created to appear, act and behave as<br>humans, and hypothetically one day we could be none the wiser.<br><br>For now, the human field of technology and<br>Machine Learning is safe from being taken by the machines. That is, until the<br>machines themselves learn to make better machines. I think that is a good<br>reason to study in IT and other technology/computer related fields. The future<br>with Machine Learning doesn’t have to be all bleak; many exciting opportunities<br>are opened by it, and humanity can achieve a lot of progress and solve numerous<br>problems that currently face us. Just don’t give the self-learning machines<br>control of the nukes.<br></p>

                                <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Internet of Things-enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is gaining<br>significant attention in academic literature and industry, and are seen as a<br>solution to enhancing road safety in smart cities. Due to the ever-increasing<br>number of vehicles, a significant rise in the number of road accidents has been<br>observed.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerous deaths are caused by traffic<br>accidents worldwide. The global crisis of road safety can be seen by observing<br>the significant number of deaths and injuries that are caused by road traffic<br>accidents. In many situations, the family members or emergency services are not<br>informed in time. This results in delayed emergency service response time,<br>which can lead to an individual’s death or cause severe injury. The purpose of<br>this work is to reduce the response time of emergency services in situations<br>like traffic accidents or other emergencies such as fire, theft/robberies and<br>medical emergencies. By utilizing onboard sensors of a smartphone to detect<br>vehicular accidents and report them to the nearest emergency responder<br>available and provide real-time location tracking for responders and emergency<br>victims, will drastically increase the chances of survival for emergency<br>victims, and also help save emergency services time and resources.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the number of deaths and<br>injuries due to road traffic accidents shows the global crisis of road safety.<br>Nearly 1.3 million people are killed every year and about 50 million are<br>injured worldwide due to road accidents, which averages to 3,287 lives lost<br>every day. More than 50 per cent of road traffic deaths affect young adults<br>between the age of 15-44. Around 400,000 individuals under the age of 25 die in<br>road traffic accidents every year. Even in countries with very good road safety<br>measures, the number of road accident deaths is getting higher every year. More<br>than 90% of road traffic deaths occur in middle-income countries. In low-income<br>countries, the figure is even higher. the overall number of deaths in road<br>accidents is about 55 per cent, which according to the specialists is very<br>high. According to the data, a total of 51,416 individuals died in 97,739 road<br>accidents across the country. Furthermore, the data shows that deaths per<br>accident are 55 per cent around the country<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most likely reason for an individual's<br>death in an accident is the lack of the first aid provision that is because of<br>emergency services not receiving information about the accident in time.<br>Emergency response time is extremely vital when it involves incidents involving<br>vehicle accidents. Analysis shows that if we decrease just 1-minute in accident<br>response time that can increase chances of saving an individual’s life up to<br>six per cent. In order to reduce response time, implementation of enhanced<br>traffic technologies would be necessary, which will help scale back response<br>time and therefore reduce fatalities.<br></p>
